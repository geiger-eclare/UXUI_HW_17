# UXUI_HW_17
A simulated rendition of my portfolio, created for the purpose of honing my skills in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and JQuery, providing me with a practical avenue to refine my ability to manipulate web elements and enhance design concepts. This coded portfolio differs somewhat from my actual Squarespace-based portfolio and serves as a valuable practice ground for my developing skills.
